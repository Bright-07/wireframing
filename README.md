# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial part of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure of a web page or app interface. Wireframes are often referred to as the “blueprints” of a digital product because they help define the layout, functionality, and navigation flow before any design or code is written.

Wireframes are typically stripped of color, images, and detailed styling — their main focus is to establish where content and elements will go and how users will interact with the system. This makes them an effective communication tool for designers, developers, and stakeholders, allowing teams to agree on the core structure before building begins.

Wireframing helps in:

- Visualizing interface structure
- Detecting usability issues early
- Enhancing collaboration and feedback
- Saving time and resources in development
